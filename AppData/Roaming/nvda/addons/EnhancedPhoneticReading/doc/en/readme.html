<h2>Features.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Delayed descriptions: Announce the character description for the last read character after n milliseconds when the character was read by character review commands, E.G. left and right arrow keys, left, current or right character review commands, ETC.  </li>
<li>Instant character descriptions: Read the character description instead of the current character. This feature must be enabled or disabled manually and will be deactivated when NVDA is closed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes.</h2>
<ul>
<li>When instant character descriptions are enabled, delayed descriptions won't be announced.</li>
<li>This add-on considers the auto language switching also. So if the last read character captured by this add-on was spoken in another language of your current default language, and auto language switching is on, the description will be read in the detected language.</li>
<li>For delayed descriptions only: all characters that don't have a description available for the specified language (locale characterDescriptions.dic) will be ignored. E.G. if you read the character "4" and the current default or detected language is Spanish, you won't get a delayed description because Spanish  doesn't have a description for that symbol.</li>
<li>For developers: In general, any character sent with textInfos.UNIT_CHARACTER argument to speech.speakTextInfo will activate a delayed character description.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>You need NVDA 2018.3 or later.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Just install it as a NVDA add-on.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The add-on functionality will be enabled once you install it.<br />
  To enable or disable it, go to NVDA settings and select "Enhanced phonetic reading". In that category you can set the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable delayed descriptions for characters.</li>
<li>Delay to announce  character descriptions (in ms): the time the add-on waits to speak the description for the read character. You can't set it greater than 20000 ms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<ul>
<li>toggle instant character descriptions: Assigned to "nvda + control + numpad2" or "nvda+ control + enter" for laptop keyboards. This script enables or disables the instant character descriptions feature.</li>
<li>toggle delayed descriptions: no gestures assigned. This script lets you toggle the delayed descriptions status.  </li>
</ul>
<p>You can assign a command or gesture in speech category in the  NVDA input gestures dialog.</p>
<h2>Contributing to translation.</h2>
<p>In order to make your work easier, I have left a 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/EnhancedPhoneticReading/master/EnhancedPhoneticReading.pot">translation template in the master branch.</a>
If you want to translate this add-on to another language and you don't want to open a github account or install python and other tools needed for the translation, do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/EnhancedPhoneticReading/master/EnhancedPhoneticReading.pot">this template</a>,
as a base for the target language.</li>
<li>Download
<a href="https://poedit.net/">"poedit"</a>,
this software will help you manage the translation strings.</li>
<li>If you want to translate the documentation too, you can use the
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/EnhancedPhoneticReading/master/readme.md">English documentation at this link.</a></li>
<li>Once you finished the translation, you can send me it to: "dhf360@gmail.com".</li>
</ol>
<p>You won't need to compile the source files. I'll do it when releasing a new add-on version. I will mention your name in the respective commit. If you don't wish to be mentioned, let me in the e-mail.</p>
<p>Note: make sure you have used the latest translation strings template.</p>
<p>This is an alternative method. If you want, you always can go by the usual way. Fork this repo, update the translation for your language, and send me a PR. But this way just will add more complexity for you.</p>
