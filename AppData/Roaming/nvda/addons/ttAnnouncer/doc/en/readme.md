# ttAnnouncer

NVDA addon for reading channel messages in TeamTalk application using different tts from main engine.

## Why this addon exist
I am using TeamTalk application on daily bases for different purposes and sometimes besides voice communication there are frequent chat messages.
I want to stay focussed what i am doing and do not distract to read chats or flush them accidentally. So i wrote an addon which makes it possible to select a different text to speech engine from settings to read TeamTalk channel messages.

## Shortcuts
There is only one shortcut - NVDA+Shift+pause, which on first press stops incoming speech from TeamTalk and pressing twice toggles functionality to on/off.
