description = """This add-on helps you position yourself in front of the camera for video calls.
It will tell you if you are too close or too far from the camera,
if you are too much to the left or right, if you are too high or too low,
and if the lighting is too dark or too bright. It will also tell you
if you are too close to the edge of the frame, which may indicate that you are too close to the edge of the camera's field of view."""
