<h1>
TTConv, the TeamTalk Configuration File Converter<br/>
Doug Lee<br/>
Last Revised May, 2024
</h1>

<p>
This utility is designed to help with the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Migrating from TeamTalk 5 Classic to the regular TeamTalk 5 QT client.
<li>Producing an HTML file containing links for all servers in a TeamTalk configuration file, such as for
posting to Dropbox for use on a phone.
<li>Updating secondary configuration profile server lists after adding or changing servers in the primary
configuration.
<li>Mass creation of <code>.tt</code> files, one for each server in a TeamTalk server or latest-hosts list.
</ul>

<p>
TTConv is a console application and can be run either with command-line options or without arguments in an
interactive mode.
At this time, the interactive mode is only for migration of servers from the Classic client to the Qt client;
the other uses require command-line arguments.

<h2 id="requirements">System Requirements</h2>

<p>
On Windows, users can run the executable (<code>.exe</code>) version of this utility.
Those wishing to run this utility from source on Windows must first download and install a version of Python
3.7 or later.

<p>
On MacOS, Linux, and other Python-supporting platforms, make sure to run this utility via Python 3.7 or later.

<h2 id="inst">Installation and Launch Instructions</h2>

<p>
To install and launch this utility:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.dlee.org/teamtalk/ttconv/ttconv.zip">Download the TTConv zip file</a>,
and extract the zip's contents into a location of your choosing.
Alternatively, on Windows, simply <a href="https://www.dlee.org/teamtalk/ttconv/ttconv.exe">download the Windows
executable</a> and place it in a location of your choosing.
<li>Run the utility from its extracted or downloaded location.
Do not try to run the utility from inside the Zip file.
On Windows, run <code>ttconv.exe</code>.
On other operating systems, or on Windows with Python 3.7 or later installed, run <code>ttconv.py</code> via the
correct Python command.
</ol>

<h2 id=use>TTConv Usage</h2>

<p>
This document will use the command <code>ttconv</code> to indicate launching TTConv.
If you are using the Windows executable, it might be necessary to type the full path to TTConv, such as <code>c:\TTConv\ttconv.exe</code> instead.
To run TTConv from source, on Windows after installing Python 3.7 or later or on any other operating system,
it will more likely be necessary to type something like <code>python c:\TTConv\ttconv.py</code> or <code>python3 c:\TTConv\ttconv.py</code>.

<h3 id=use_migrate>Migrating From the Classic Client To the Qt Client</h3>

<p>
For the most common interactive use, migrating from Classic to Qt,
TTConv is designed not to require being launched from within a shell window (e.g., <code>cmd</code> on Windows).
This is why TTConv will often stop before closing with a message like "Press Enter to exit."
This facilitates use of TTConv via a Windows or similar shortcut or from Windows Explorer or similar.

<p>
If run without command-line arguments, TTConv will
currently assume that a Classic-to-QT migration is wanted and will analyze files accordingly.
If items are found to migrate, TTConv will offer to convert them. Otherwise it will report finding nothing and
prompt to exit.

<p id=portable>
Before proceeding, TTConv will ask whether you wish to migrate a portable TeamTalk instance. Most users will
probably answer no (<kbd>n</kbd>) to this question and migrate an installed TeamTalk instance.
If you do wish to migrate a portable copy, answer yes (<kbd>y</kbd>) and then, when prompted, enter the path
to the folder containing the portable TeamTalk files.

<p>
When TTConv finds entries in the TeamTalk 5 Qt client <code>.ini</code> file, it will indicate this and will
prompt for permission to replace those entries. This will happen if you have previously migrated or if you
have already added servers to the Qt client. The number of servers found in the Qt file should help in
choosing whether to proceed with the current migration.

<h3 id=use_html>Creating an HTML Version of a Set of Servers</h3>

<p>
TTConv is capable of making an HTML file in which servers appear as links. This can be especially useful for
phone users who also use a file sharing service, such as Dropbox, to pass files between Mac or Windows and a phone.

<p>
<strong>Warning</strong>: As currently written, TTConv does not pause after messages before exiting when used
in this mode.
This contrasts with TTConv's behavior when used to migrate servers from the Classic client to the Qt client.
Rationale: Whereas migration from the Classic client to the Qt client is likely to be a one-time or at least
infrequent event, creation/updating of an HTML version of a TeamTalk server list can remain perpetually useful
as the server list evolves. The expected usage, therefore, is via a shortcut, written once and run as needed.

<p>
To create an HTML version of a set of servers, type a command line that includes an indication of which
servers to use and where to store the resulting HTML file. An example:
<blockquote><code>
c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe .ini c:\Dropbox\tt.htm
</code></blockquote>
In this example:
<ul>
<li><code>c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe</code> is the full path to the Windows executable instance of TTConv.
<li><code>.ini</code> causes TTConv to use the named servers in the Windows Qt client's configuration file.
To use the latest-hosts section instead, use <code>.ini:l</code>.
<li><code>c:\Dropbox\tt.htm</code> is the full path of the file to create.
If this file already exists, it will be replaced.
</ul>

<p>
To facilitate running the above HTML generation periodically after TeamTalk servers are added, modified, etc.,
make a Desktop shortcut whose "Target" field is a command such as the one in the preceding example.
It is likely even possible to run such updates on a schedule in the background, though means of setting this
up fall beyond the scope of this documentation.

<h3 id=use_prof>Updating Secondary TeamTalk Configuration Profile Server Lists</h3>

<p>
Some TeamTalk users maintain secondary configuration profiles, such as for different sound setups. As the
primary server list evolves, keeping secondary profile server lists up to date can become laborious.
TTConv can help with this by transferring the primary server list to a secondary profile with a single
command.

<p>
As with creating HTML server lists, the expected usage of this profile server list copying feature is
periodic; therefore, there is no pause after messages in this mode of operation.
A Windows shortcut for this purpose may very well prove very effective. Example:
<blockquote><code>
c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe .ini .ini.1
</code></blockquote>
If multiple secondary profiles must periodically be updated, create one shortcut for each, or create a
<code>.bat</code>, <code>.cmd</code>, or similar script file that updates them all, then make a shortcut
that runs that file.
An example <code>.bat</code> or <code>.cmd</code> file of this sort:
<blockquote><code>
@echo off
c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe .ini .ini.1
c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe .ini .ini.2
c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe .ini .ini.3
</code></blockquote>
Note that each secondary profile should already exist, having been created by TeamTalk itself prior to being
updated by this utility.
TTConv should not be used to create secondary profiles because this would not include required information
that TeamTalk needs.

<h3 id=use_tt>Creating .tt Files For a Set of Servers</h3>

<p>
TTConv can populate a folder with a set of <code>.tt</code> files, one per server in a server or latest-hosts
list. TeamTalk can then be launched directly into a server, and possibly channel, by activating a
<code>.tt</code> file, such as by clicking or pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> on it from Windows Explorer or
activating it from the Finder in MacOS. <code>.tt</code> files may also work to launch TeamTalk on other
platforms.

<p>
<strong>Warning</strong>: As currently written, TTConv does not pause after messages before exiting when used
in this mode. See the similar warning and rationale in the previous section regarding the creation of HTML
server lists.

<p>
To create a set of <code>.tt</code> files from a server list, type a command line that includes an indication of which
servers to use and where to store the resulting <code>.tt</code> files. An example:
<blockquote><code>
c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe .ini c:\Dropbox\ttfiles/.tt
</code></blockquote>
In this example:
<ul>
<li><code>c:\ttconv\ttconv.exe</code> is the full path to the Windows executable instance of TTConv.
<li><code>.ini</code> causes TTConv to use the named servers in the Windows Qt client's configuration file.
To use the latest-hosts section instead, use <code>.ini:l</code>.
<li><code>c:\Dropbox\ttfiles/.tt</code> is the full path of the folder where the <code>.tt</code> files should
be created, plus the trailing "<code>/.tt</code>" which indicates that <code>.tt</code> files are wanted.
The specified folder must already exist.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Warning</strong>: TTConv does not check whether the given folder is empty and does not check for
pre-existing <code>.tt</code> files within it. Consequences:
<ul>
<li>If any <code>.tt</code> files exist already that are not regenerated during this TTConv run, they will
remain unchanged.
<li>Any pre-existing <code>.tt</code> file that is generated anew by this TTConv run will quietly replace any
identically-named file with the updated version.
<li>Any files other than <code>.tt</code> files in the folder will remain unchanged.
</ul>

<h2 id=issues>Known Issues</h2>

<p>
Issues shown in this section may be fixed in future TTConv versions.

<p>
Alternate TeamTalk configuration profiles are not yet supported during a migration from the Classic client to
the Qt client. They may of course be handled via individual TTConv runs with command lines that request
copying of specific server lists among specific files.

<p>
The support for generating <code>.tt</code> files is perhaps less than ideal, in that it provides no simple
means to keep a folder precisely synchronized with a TeamTalk configuration file. Because the HTML approach
fills the needs previously filled by <code>.tt</code> files, however, this author does not predict this
shortcoming to be a significant problem.

<h2 id=hist>Revision History</h2>

<p>
Here is the revision history of TTConv, most recent entry first:
Note that the revision numbers are artificially high because this project began as part of another much older one.

<h3>Revision 1270, May 17, 2024</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added read/write access to TeamTalk Qt non-primary profile configurations, which have their
normal extensions followed by <code>.1</code>, <code>.2</code>, etc.
This facilitates <a href="#use_prof">transfer of the primary server list to non-primary profiles</a>,
such as after adding a new server to the main configuration file.
Read-only Classic non-primary profile access is also included,
which facilitates converting Classic non-primary profiles to Qt. This usage has not been carefully tested,
however.
<li>Stopped adding spaces around equals signs (<kbd>=</kbd>) when updating <kbd>.ini</kbd> files.
This oddity was actually a side effect of using the third-party Iniparse library.
The effect for most users of this change is negligible, especially since TeamTalk itself quietly removes
such spaces on first accessing the file.
This change was introduced and posted shortly after the initial May 17, 2024 release of this utility as
revision 1269.
</ul>

<h3>Revision 1267, January 12, 2024</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug, when reading an HTML file for conversion to another format, that caused ports to be set to 0 when they were the default of 10333
and not actually included in the HTML link.
<li>Improved formatting of text produced by <code>ttconv -h</code> or <code>ttconv --help</code>.
<li>Old history entries in this document section are now hidden inside a <code>details</code> tag
that may be expanded to show them. Among the benefits of this, heading count is reduced and text searches won't
match very old material.
</ul>

<h3>Revision 1260, June 23, 2023</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed three errors reported by Batuhan Demir on my Telegram discussion group:
<ul>
<li>A typing error in code that caused the wrong variable name to be referenced under some conditions.
<li>A logic error that caused migration of a normal (non-portable) configuration to fail.
<li>An error that caused migration of configurations with missing XML sections to fail.
This would have affected those who, for example, never named a TeamTalk server in the local client.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Revision 1258, May 15, 2023</h3>
<ul>
<li>When launched without arguments, TTConv will
<a href="#portable">offer to migrate a portable TeamTalk instance</a> before
proceeding with the migration.
<li>There is a bit more protection against error tracebacks when attempting to convert an xml file that does
not contain any servers.
</ul>

<details><summary>3 older revisions back through July 4, 2021</summary>
<h3>Revision 1256, January 1, 2023</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed missing file issue in the zip file version of this utility.
</ul>

<h3>Revision 1255, December 5, 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>The license under which TTConv is distributed is now the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, version 3</a>.
The original July, 2021 release of this utility fell under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, version 3</a>.
The included <code>copying.txt</code> file is correspondingly updated.
The most substantial difference is the handling of web servers that use this code.
<li>Fixed a small and harmless (though potentially confusing) bug that caused a few fields to be placed in Qt
configuration files though they are not used by TeamTalk itself. The fields are <code>shortname</code>,
<code>url</code>, and <code>srvpassword</code>.
Industrious users who manually edit their TeamTalk5.ini files may safely remove any instances of these fields,
but leaving them in the file is harmless.
<li>If there are already servers in the Qt configuration file, this is reported before migration; and the
migration confirmation prompt includes the word "replace" to draw attention to that effect of migrating.
<li>TTConv supports creation of a set of <code>.tt</code> files from a TeamTalk configuration file section.
<li>This documentation is significantly enhanced, notably including the addition of sections separately describing
each supported usage of the utility.
<li>Servers taken from a <code>[latesthosts]</code> section are named more like TeamTalk itself would
name them.  This doesn't matter for a Classic-to-Qt migration but will for command-line-based server movement
among file formats; notably, when creating an HTML version of a latest-hosts section. This usage is expected to
be very rare.
<li>An unused <code>-m</code> command-line option is removed.
<li>Various files accidentally included but not needed at runtime are omitted to conserve executable file size.
</ul>

<h3>Revision 1232, July 4, 2021</h3>
<p>
First public release.
This release was published very rapidly to coincide with the unexpected timing of the initial TeamTalk 5.8.0
Qt release.
Various older versions existed, back through February, 2013; but all were considered experimental and not
formally released. The original provisional name for the utility was <code>IXConv</code>.
Work on this incarnation began on February 5, 2013, as part of this author's experimentation with non-Classic
Windows and MacOS TeamTalk clients.
